This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Contact the other dev teams to get ENV values needed and NPM_TOKEN to access our private registry.

Create you own `.env` file in you local machine, refer to `.env.example` for ENV keys and value needed.

Export the NPM_TOKEN value to your environment variable. You may also add this to you `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` to avoid running it every time.

```
export NPM_TOKEN=<token_value>
```

Install Dependencies:
```
yarn
```

Run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
